                    <h1>NHA DAO</h1>
                    <h2>GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION SYSTEMS (GIS) ANALYST</h2>

                    <p>My immediate goal is to be promoted to GIS manager.
                        I want to be successful in my career and for that 
                        reason, I've taken computer courses such as Python
                        and Javascript to complement my GIS skills. It's a lot
                        of work but i'm excited and motivated. I was able to 
                        incorporate what I learned in Python to enhance some 
                        of my GIS projects. As for Javascript, I have some
                        ideas for some projects I want to work on.
                    </p>
                    <!-- e.g. I love building websites, and learning to code! -->
                    <p>Some of the things I enjoy doing is traveling, camping, 
                        backpacking, fishing, gardening, cooking.
                    </p>
                    <!-- e.g. I spent my weekends in the mountains hiking with my friends. -->
